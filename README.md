I initially created NineMusic as a complement for my [NineUnlock](https://github.com/minh-ton/NineUnlock) tweak, to provide the full experience of the iOS 9 lockscreen by styling the lockscreen music player. It is no longer maintained and is now archived on GitHub.

The release post for NineMusic can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/jly690/free_release_ninemusic_bring_back_the_ios_9/).
